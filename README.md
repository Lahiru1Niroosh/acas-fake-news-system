# ACAS – Fake News Detection & Privacy-Aware Verification System

## 📌 Project Overview
ACAS (Automated Credibility Assessment System) is a privacy-first, multi-agent fake news detection platform designed to verify health-related and news-related social media content.  
The system uses a **CrewAI-based agent orchestration framework** combined with **FastAPI** and **React** to analyze tweets containing text, images, or both, while ensuring **user metadata privacy through PII masking**.

The platform demonstrates a **plug-and-play architecture**, allowing independently trained AI models to be integrated seamlessly into the verification pipeline.

---

## 🎯 Problem Addressed
The rapid spread of fake news—especially in health, political, and public safety domains—causes misinformation, panic, and loss of trust.

Existing solutions often lack:
- Privacy protection
- Explainable decisions
- Modular AI integration

ACAS addresses these gaps through **privacy-aware processing, explainable AI (XAI), and modular agent orchestration**.

IT22594990 – Ranasinghe K.D

### 1. Component Overview

This component focuses on Image Authenticity Detection, aiming to determine whether an image shared on social media platforms is AI-generated or human-made (real). With the rapid growth of AI-generated visual content, visual misinformation has become increasingly difficult to detect through manual inspection.

The Image Authenticity Detection module leverages deep learning–based computer vision techniques to analyze visual artifacts, textures, and structural patterns that differentiate synthetic images from real photographs. This component operates as an ImageAgent within the CrewAI multi-agent framework and provides reliable image credibility outputs to the AggregatorAgent for multimodal credibility assessment.

# COMPONENT 3  - IT22067074

## Multimodal Contextual Similarity Verification Module

### Component Description
A multimodal module to verify contextual similarity between text and images using external tools and explainable AI principles.


### Project Overview
With the rapid spread of misinformation across digital platforms, verifying the contextual alignment between images and textual claims has become a critical challenge. This project proposes and implements a **Multimodal Contextual Similarity Verification Module** that evaluates whether an image and a given text are semantically and contextually aligned.

The system leverages a **pretrained CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining)** model, integrates **OCR-based text extraction** for images containing embedded text, and applies **cosine similarity scoring** to detect contextual matches or mismatches. The solution is designed to be **scalable, explainable**, and suitable for **misinformation detection and fact-checking scenarios**.

### Objectives
- Verify contextual similarity between image and text inputs  
- Detect semantic mismatches indicative of misinformation  
- Integrate OCR for images containing embedded textual information  
- Support extension to external fact-checking tools (e.g., FactCrescendo)  
- Provide **explainable similarity decisions** rather than black-box predictions  


### System Architecture
The system follows a multimodal pipeline combining image processing, text understanding, and explainable decision logic.

**High-level flow:**




























### Explainable AI (XAI) Perspective
Unlike traditional classification-based models, this system is explicitly designed using **Explainable AI (XAI)** principles.

#### 1. Similarity Score Exposure
Each image–text pair produces a **numeric cosine similarity score** representing semantic alignment between visual and textual content.

#### 2. Threshold-Based Decision Logic
Decisions are made using a **transparent threshold mechanism**:
- Similarity ≥ Threshold → **MATCH**
- Similarity < Threshold → **MISMATCH**

The threshold value is **empirically adjusted** based on experimental observations.

#### 3. OCR Evidence Integration
For images containing embedded text, OCR-extracted content is:
- Explicitly displayed
- Included in similarity computation  
This allows users to understand **why** a decision was made.

#### 4. Interpretability Over Prediction
Instead of producing opaque predictions, the system outputs:
- Similarity score
- OCR-extracted text (if present)
- Final contextual decision  

This design makes the system suitable for **fact-checking, misinformation analysis, and research explainability requirements**.


### Technologies & Tools Used

###$ AI & ML Models
- **CLIP (ViT-B/32)** – Pretrained multimodal image–text model
- **EasyOCR** – Optical Character Recognition for embedded image text

#### Programming & Libraries
- Python 3  
- PyTorch  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Pillow (PIL)  

#### Platforms
- Google Colab (GPU-enabled)  
- GitHub (Version Control)  


### Datasets
- **Custom Test Images**
  - Used to demonstrate real-world scenarios and explainability.


### Decision Logic
A cosine similarity threshold is applied to determine contextual alignment:
- Similarity ≥ Threshold → **MATCH**
- Similarity < Threshold → **MISMATCH**

The threshold is adjustable and tuned based on experimental results to balance sensitivity and robustness.
